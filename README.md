# XYZReader - Make Your App Material (Project 5)
##Project Overview
In this project,the goal is to redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

##Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

##What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

##Dependencies

* OkHttp 1.1.0
* Volley
* Android Design Support Library 

##Rubric

* App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
* App theme extends from AppCompat.
* App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for App bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
